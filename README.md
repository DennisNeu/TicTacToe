# TicTacToe
A simple, command line based TicTacToe game
I made this a few months ago, back when I had only learned basic Java Syntax and had no idea what OOP is
so the game resides in just one class and the code looks messy but oh well, I dont really know what my code does but it works!

Code is in English, ingame text is in German

The project leaves much room for optimization. Certain things can be done in a simpler manner and readability could be improved. I might do so in the future.
